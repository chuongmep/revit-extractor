## Revit Extractor

Revit Extractor is a library that allows you to export native data from Revit files without needing to open Revit. Itâ€™s particularly useful for extracting data from Revit files and integrating it into other systems.

## Requirements

- Make sure you have Revit installed on your machine.
- Make sure you have Python installed on your machine version `3.9` or later.
- Make sure you are running on Windows Platform. MacOS and Linux are not supported. 

## How to use

1. Install the library by using pip:
```bash
pip install revit-extractor --upgrade
```

2. Get Revit Version 

```
from revit_extract import RevitExtractor
rvt_path = r"D:\_WIP\Download\Sample Office Building Model V1.rvt"
version = RevitExtractor.get_version(rvt_path)
print(version)
```

3. Use the library in your code:

- Extract all categories from Revit file:

```python
from revit_extract import RevitExtractor
rvt_path = r"D:\_WIP\Download\Sample Office Building Model V1.rvt"
prodb = RevitExtractor(rvt_path).read_prob_data()
categories = prodb.get_all_categories()
for key in categories:
    print(key, categories[key])
```

- Extract data by categories and parameters from Revit file:
```python
from revit_extract import RevitExtractor
rvt_path = r"D:\_WIP\Download\Sample Office Building Model V1.rvt"
prodb = RevitExtractor(rvt_path).read_prob_data()
categories =["Walls", "Doors"]
params = ["Name", "Type", "Level"]
data_frame = prodb.get_data_by_categories_and_params(categories, params)
data_frame.to_excel("output.xlsx", index=False)
```
